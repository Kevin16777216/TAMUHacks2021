# Minos' Quest
### Project submission for [TamuHack](https://tamuhack.com) 2021  
  
2d labrynth tile game where players can go through puzzles to try and solve them with the help of another player. One of the main puzzles the game has is a 
puzzle called “Witch Hunt”. In Witch Hunt, a person has been murdered and there are 4 main suspects that could have potentially did the crime. 
There are a limited amount of details, and it is up to you and the other player to collaborate to think and come to a verdict on who committed 
the murder. Once you guess the correct person who committed the crime, you win the puzzle and move on to the next puzzle!  
The goal is to maneuver around the labrynth by completing puzzles and utilizing custom tiles to reach the end.
